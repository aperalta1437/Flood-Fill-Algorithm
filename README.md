# FloodFill
The floodfill algorithm gets demostraded with a sample image that results into another image after the implementing the algorithm to change color of the specified section.

This algorithm could have been implemented using an iterative approach; however, the use of recursion brings a cleaner approach that prefectly demostrates the algorithm's pattern.
